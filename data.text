Key economists see the next meeting in September 2024 being a 25 basis point cut for rates, likely followed by another 25 basis point cut at the final meeting in November.

This broadly reflects South Africa’s forward rate agreement (FRA curve), which is now factoring in almost an 80% chance of a 25bp interest rate cut at the September MPC meeting and just above a 40% chance of another at the November MPC meeting.

However, while the looming rate cuts will bring much-needed relief to countrywide households, they will also likely put pressure on the rand.

According to Investec chief economist, Annabel Bishop, this is because of the proximity to the US Fed’s expected rate cut, also pencilled in for September.

Bishop previously noted that a delay in interest rate cuts in South Africa, and a quickening in the start of the US interest rate cutting cycle would widen the differential between South African and US interest rates, which would add to rand strength.

The rand weakened over 2022 and 2023 as the US hiked its interest rates more quickly with its monetary policy meeting every six weeks, and South Africa’s MPC meeting every two months
